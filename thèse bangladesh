Abstract
Purpose: Over all purpose of this study is to investigate the behavioral intentions of consumers
towards adoption of Uber with focus on effects of digitalization and shared economy on adoption
of Uber. Another objective is to examine the cultural factors of Bangladesh and Pakistan which
are leading people towards adoption of non-traditional sources of transport.
Design/Methodology/Approach: Theory of Planned Behavior integrated with Hofstede’s
Cultural Dimensions has been used to examine the Behavioral Intention of customers towards
adoption of Uber. Further, the effects of Technology Adoption Model and two other factors, Risk
and Trust, on Behavioral Intention of using Uber have been investigated. Data was collected
through questionnaires from 145 respondents from Bangladesh and Pakistan.
Findings: Empirical findings show that Risk negatively affects the Behavioral Intention. Furthere,
Attitude Towards Behavior is highly positively significant when it is moderated by Masculinity
and Uncertainty Avoidance positively moderates the relation between Social Norms and
Behavioral Intention, while Uncertainty Avoidance moderates the relation between Perceived
Behavioral Control and Behavioral Intention negatively. Moreover, study also shows that women
are more interested in using Uber service.
Limitations of Study: Data is collected through online close-ended questionnaires which limits
the generalization of the study.
Managerial Implications: Study identifies the female as a bigger market and provides an
opportunity to Uber to categorize the risks prevalent in the society and define new strategies by
adapting to the local culture by being a global company.
Keywords: Theory of Planned Behavior, Technology Adoption Model, Hofstede’s Cultural
Dimensions, Risk, Trust, Digitalization, Shared Economy.

CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION
1.1 Background and purpose of the study
The world is in the midst of unprecedented urbanization, with cities expected to hold 5.2 billion
residents by 2050 (Irigoyen, 2014). This trend poses the major threat for big cities in terms of
mobility or transportation of people. Transport is prerequisite for the bright future of cities as it
serves as a bridge between people and their routine life segments and processes. Transport industry
has been affected in developing and underdeveloped countries, like Bangladesh and Pakistan, due
to inefficient planning and insufficient funding. While talking about Bangladesh, there are
different factors which cause increase in travel time and economic cost. The number of vehicles
on city roads in Bangladesh increased 16 times between 2001 and 2013, while motorized public
transport accounts for only 23 percent of trips (Bank, 2016).
To overcome these challenges of increased urbanization, better urban transportation is inevitable
to reduce poverty and enhance economic growth. For this purpose, there is need to decrease
dependencies upon traditional modes of doing business in transport sector. This has been possible
with the invention of internet, or particularly with digitalization. This digitalization has
transformed the ways of businesses by actively responding to the rapidly changing needs of people.
It has converged the resources possessed by different entities for the collective benefits of the
society, thus establishing the shared economy. Shared economy is a sustainable economic system
built around the sharing of private assets. This rather new system mostly relies on information
technology (P2P) to empower individuals and other profit and non-profit organizations with ways
of sharing excess capacity in goods, knowledge and services (Korona & Grzunov 2014).
This sharing of resources with the help of technology, brings the underutilized resources into
mobilization and thus maximum output would be possible from limited resources. These new
ventures such as Airbnb and Uber have caused a threat for traditional businesses such as hotel
industry or taxi industry. Following the model of “shared economy”, in the light of “digitalization”,
Uber aims to gather the resources held by one person and makes it useful for the other person in
generating revenue for all stakeholders. Uber started in 2009 with the help of an app and began
2
raising venture capital and as by September 2014, Uber had accumulated over $1.5 billion in
venture capital and operates in more than 70 cities in 45 countries (Cusumano, 2015).
However, response of people towards this digitalization could be different in different societies.
Every society is a combination of different mental and practical approaches and thus differs from
other societies in terms of cultures. The purpose of this study is to explore the behavior patterns of
consumers towards adoption of Uber in Bangladesh and Pakistan. Study will aim to find out how
behaviors and intentions of people are formed for the adoption and usage of assets of shared
technology in the form of ‘Uber’. It will also focus on finding out the cultural factors which can
mold the behaviors of people towards adoption of technology.
1.2 Research problem
Difference in cultures of different societies molds the attitude of people differently towards
intention and behavior of usage and adoption of certain products or services which are launched
in the market. People from different cultures have different perceptions and thoughts about the
new products and services which reflect their behavior about using these products or services.
According to Hofstede (2011), culture is the collective programming of the mind that distinguishes
the members of one group or category of people from others. He has categorized the culture on the
basis of six dimensions which are Power distance, Uncertainty avoidance, Individualism vs
Collectivism, Masculinity vs Femininity, Long-term vs Short-term orientation, and Indulgence vs
Restraint. Based on these cultural factors, users may have different perceptions about benefits of
a technology. Adoption of technology can be understood by Technology Adoption Model (TAM).
According to Davis (1989), the TAM posits that user adoption is determined by two key beliefs,
namely, perceived usefulness (PU) and perceived ease of adoption (PEU). "Perceived Usefulness"
is defined as the extent to which a person believes that using a particular technology will enhance
his or his job performance, and "Perceived Ease of Use" is defined as the degree to which a person
believes that using a technology will be free from effort (Calantone, Griffith, & Yalcinkaya, 2006).
These perceptions further affect the intentions of consumers towards using a technology. Theory
of Planned Behavior (TPB) suggests that intentions are assumed to capture motivational factors
for that may influence a behavior. The theory of planned behavior postulates three conceptually
3
independent determinants of intention. The first is the Attitude toward Behavior (ATB) and refers
to the degree to which a person has a favorable or unfavorable evaluation or appraisal of the
behavior in question. The second predictor is a social factor termed Subjective Norms (SN), it
refers to the perceived social pressure to perform or not to perform the behavior. The third
antecedent of intention is the degree of Perceived Behavioral Control (PBC) which refers to the
perceived ease or difficulty of performing the behavior and it is assumed to reflect experience as
well as anticipated impediments and obstacles (Ajzen, 1991). Therefore, in the light of abovementioned Hofstede’s dimensions of culture and theories of TAM and TPB, following are the
possible questions for the study.
Therefore, in the light of above-mentioned Hofstede’s dimensions of culture and theories of TAM
and TPB, our research question for the study is.
Which factors influence the adoption of non-traditional mode of transport in a developing
country?
To answer this research question, our empirical context is the use of non-traditional mode of
transport such as Uber in Bangladesh and in Pakistan. The transport sector has been facing
problems in many a country due to enhanced urbanization because of globalization and
concentration of industries in big cities. In transport sector, although taxi service is highly
regulated, it is not commonly available in small and underdeveloped societies whereas private cars
can be found abundantly. This study is of much practical implication to businesses and
policymakers concerning strategies for maximum utilization of underutilized resources to look
upon the ways for the maximum utilization of underutilized resources by motivating consumers to
reduce the dependencies upon traditional businesses. It will provide practical background for
considering the cultural factors which can inhibit or enhance the attitude, intentions and behaviors
of consumers in adopting a new mode of transport.
1.3 Scope of the study
This study analyzes the cultural and behavior factors which promote or hinder the adoption of
Uber in Bangladesh and in Pakistan. This study is based on a sample of 145 responses gathered
4
through a survey using questionnaires. Although this study is from Bangladesh and Pakistan from
main cities of these countries, its results could be generalized to other countries like India due to
cultural and economic similarities.

CHAPTER 2: LITERATURE AND THEORY REVIEW
2.1 Introduction
In the first chapter of our thesis we have seen the purpose of the study, research problem and scope
of the study. We have also come up with a question in the “research problem” part. In chapter two,
overall focus will be on the digital transformation, changing business models, empowerment of
shared economy, assessing the sharing economy, technology adoption model, Hofstede’s cultural
dimensions and theory of planned behavior. Uber is a very rapidly growing e-commerce in
Bangladesh and Pakistan markets and we will focus on the impact of digitalization in both of these
countries via “Hofstede” model. Afterwards it will focus on challenges as well of Uber.
2.2 Digital transformation
Internet has changed our everyday lives. Digital transformation provides the value to the customers
and technical solutions provide outcomes of the business innovation. For this transformation
people across the world have come together virtually. Businesses are aiming to generate value
propositions to the end users. Digital technologies are usually used for the greater interaction with
the customers. On the other hand, the toughest approach of the digitalization is the customer
service. Customers are eager to the convenient way of shopping now a days especially the current
young generation. The interaction of the customers actually encourages the innovation for the
online communities who seek for the digital transformation.
6
Figure 2. 1: Digital Economy
Source: Delic, 2016
The graph above shows that shifts are due to major innovations which brought changes in the
economy. It shows a right ward shift from infrastructure to technology (digitalization) and from
data to digital content over the period and value has been created.
Meanwhile, for the transformation, enterprises need to transform their operating models (Berman,
2012). Conversion of digitalization must follow the path of the traditional way of doing commerce
as it provides a harmony. It is the mixture with the analogue materials of traditional form of
commerce (Routhier Perry, 2014). Along with the traditional way of commerce, digitalization has
paved a very desirable way to provide superior satisfaction to the customers now a days. In current
era, digital devices allow the vast amount of information to be connected with the end users in a
very short period of time and also by using those devices, the physical and/or tangible things are
converted into virtual objects. Today, the “light organisations” (digital businesses) are taking over
7
the “heavy organisation” (physical or tangible businesses). In the digital transformation, businesses
are connected with the customers via technologies (Tapscott, 1996). Organisations are facing new
competitors and technologies have been re-shaped accordingly for the delivery of goods and
services to the end users. However, in future, the consequences of digital transformation will
change the goals and motives of the organisations.
2.2.1 Changing Business Models
During past two decades, business models have been changed due to the digitalization in the world.
There have been some dramatic changes in the global economy for this. These explains the
strategies of online marketing and also facilitating distribution channel. The usage of modern
electronic communication has to be understood by the producers to establish a “two-way”
interaction with their priority group of customers. Not only this, the nature of the demand for
product or services must be understood as well (Picard, 2000).
Digital media makes the profession more global and interactive to the end user customers but many
practitioners are using digital media just as like they used to use the old techniques before. (Grunig,
2009). Digitalized technologies create more economies of scope which has changed the content of
distribution. These also provides the flexibility of the usage and controls the irrelevant
communication. However, for all these advantages, the producers have to understand the demand
for the goods and services (Picard, 2000).
New media has made the profession global in the digitalized era. Public relation is the management
of information provided to the public. As we know that digitalized economy has changed the
business models and introduced new models. Public relations as a strategic management must be
re-institutionalized and a model has been provided by the scholar to understand the usage of digital
media.
2.3 Empowerment of shared economy
As we have previously discussed that the world has become digitalized and businesses are engaged
across boundaries. This facilitates online marketers especially. Shared economy is being born due
8
to these dramatic changes in the usage of modern technologies. Sharing economy is the “sharing”
of the factors in the market across the border. The current generation has been brought up by the
openness of the internet. This sharing is a potential tools for the social movement but the
potentiality requires something beyond than accessing the internet (Schor, 2016). The practice of
sharing the personal services for the demand of it distinguishes the proper definition of the sharing
economy actually. The distinction between on-demand and sharing economy has been very clear
throughout the period of time as many people call “Uber” instead of calling taxi (Frenken & Schor,
2017).
Figure 2. 2: Sharing Economy and Related Forms of Platform Economy
Source: Frenken and Schor (2017)
Above figure, it illustrates that sharing economy is distinguished from three platforms. In on
demand economy, people to purchase personal services. In second hand economy, consumer to
consumer is the access of temporary physical goods that means consumers are trading off the
second handed goods. Sometimes, people give away their goods without the payment. In product
service economy, companies provide goods for rent to the consumers but the ownership is not
passed on to the consumers (Frenken & Schor, 2017).
9
2.3.1 Assessing the Sharing Economy
However, it is not only limited into “peer to peer” transactions rather it is more than what is visible.
According to the expansion of the sharing economy, practices has to be embedded in contexts
(Schor, 2016). Sustainable benefits of the sharing economy are much more complex than it has
been assumed. Undisputedly, the transaction costs are diminished due to shared economy. Some
marketers are indirectly affected by this P2P (Peer-to-Peer) sharing. The earnings many established
markets have declined for example: The hotel earning has been decreased in Texas due to the
growth and usage of Airbnb (Bergh, Truffer, & Kallis, 2011). According to the analysis it has been
revealed that the Airbnb is partial substitutes for hotel nights especially in the low budgeted hotel.
It has been assumed that the same case can go for the car rentals or in other goods or service
sectors. On the other hand, income in the welfare has been unequally distributed. Websites create
the monopoly and on-demand platforms increased inequality within the bottom 80% of the income
distribution (Bergh et al., 2011).
For the hybrid form of marketing, stakeholder role has played an agenda in the public relation. The
information of the companies often bounces randomly in the online environment and it is not an
easy task to engaging stakeholders to the pinpoint of the information. The customers need to
believe what the online provides and there is often no scope to find the actual proof or evidence of
the validity of the information (Luoma-aho, 2015). According to the assessment and analysis, it
has been found out that free-rider problems also exist in the shared economy. A decline in the
overall performance occurs when if no mechanism exists to avoid this problem which will result
in the lack of interpersonal cooperation. This problem gives birth to the “trust issues” (Zárraga &
Bonache, 2003). This incidence is clearly shown on the graph below:
10
Figure 2. 3: The Division of Faith-Holders and Hate-Holders and Consequences to Organizational
Legitimacy
Source: Luoma-aho (2015)
The figure 2.3, illustrates positively engaged faith-holders, the negatively engaged hate holders,
and fake holders the unauthentic persona (Luoma-aho, 2015). Moreover, sharing economy is
changing the traditional relationships between parties as “two-party” relationships have been
converted into “multiple party” relations. As a result, long term established lines are getting blurry
or fuzzy on which the policy actually responds.
2.4 Technology Adoption Model
In the era of globalization, companies try to compete in the divergent markets with the help of
advanced and effective technologies. Expansion in the new markets brings the challenges for the
parent firm to adapt the technology according to the local culture. For effective implementation of
11
a technology in a market, it is mandatory that the unique mixture of the local market should not be
neglected during strategy planning and implementation. According to Hakanson (2000), the
inability of an MNC to adapt to local conditions, or cultural incompatibility, and the
inappropriateness of the imported technology are considered major obstacles to the successful
adoption of new technology (Calantone et al., 2006).
Technology adoption model (TAM) was proposed by (Davis, Bagozzi, & Warshaw, 1989). It is
widely accepted as the most authentic model to study the technology adoption in different
scenarios. The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) is an information systems (IS) theory that
models the determinants of computer acceptance across a broad range of end-user computing
technologies. TAM has been used in several IS studies and has proven useful in determining
technology acceptance (McCoy, Everard, & Jones, 2005). There have been a lot of extensions in
TAM but the final model suggested by Davis (1989) has three components which are perceived
ease of use, perceived usefulness and behavioral intention. According to Davis et al. (1989),
perceived usefulness is the prospective user's subjective probability that using a specific
application system will increase his or her job performance within an organizational context and
perceived ease of use refers to the degree to which the prospective user expects the target system
to be free from effort (McCoy et al., 2005).
Figure 2. 4: Adopted Technology Adoption Model
12
This model suggests that users develop the perception regarding usefulness and ease of use of a
technology and then this perception can lead towards behavioral intention. If users find the
technology useful and easy to use, it will positively affect the behavioral intention.
2.5 Culture
As studied by , culture has been defined as; the manner in which a group of people solves problems
and reconciles dilemmas (Trompenaars and Turner, 1998), the collective mental programming of
people that distinguishes them from others (Hofstede, 2001), and the fabric of meaning through
which people interpret events around them (Geertz, 1973). In these all definitions, commonality is
present which shows that a group of people share the common values and norms which differ from
another group of people.
2.5.1 Hofstede’s Cultural Dimensions
Hofstede's research on cultural dimensions provides a theoretical foundation for exploring the
impact of cultural differences on the adoption and diffusion of IT-based innovations (Straub, Keil,
& Brenner, 1997). Hofstede has categorized a culture on following basis.
Power Distance
Power Distance has been defined as the extent to which the less powerful members of
organizations and institutions (like the family) accept and expect that power is distributed
unequally. This represents inequality (more versus less), but defined from below, not from above
(Hofstede, 2011). According to Straub et al. (1997), in societies with high power distance, the
acceptance of technologies is lower compared to the societies with low PD because they have the
higher acceptance of technologies.
Uncertainty Avoidance
Uncertainty avoidance is not the same as risk avoidance; it deals with a society's tolerance for
ambiguity. It indicates to what extent a culture programs its members to feel either uncomfortable
or comfortable in unstructured situations (Hofstede). In cultures where there is high uncertainty
avoidance, people try to use medium which are physically available such as face to face while in
13
low uncertainty avoidance cultures, people can more often use electronic medium. Therefore,
according to Straub et al. (1997), in high UA countries, TAM can be a weaker indicator for
technology use than it would be in low UA countries.
Individualism
Hofstede (2011) defines the individualist side of a cultures in which the ties between individuals
are loose: everyone is expected to look after him/herself and his/her immediate family. On the
collectivist side is a culture in which people from birth onwards are integrated into strong, cohesive
in-groups. As much studies say that collectivist cultures are resistant to technology because
electronic media reduces the face to face communication while technology acceptance is high in
individualist cultures.
Masculinity
According to Hofstede (2011), Masculinity versus its opposite, Femininity, again as a societal, not
as an individual characteristic, refers to the distribution of values between the genders which is
another fundamental issue for any society, to which a range of solutions can be found. Studies
revealed that (a) women's values differ less among societies than men's values; (b) men's values
from one country to another contain a dimension from very assertive and competitive and
maximally different from women's values on the one side, to modest and caring and similar to
women's values on the other. The assertive pole has been called 'masculine' and the modest, caring
pole 'feminine'. In less assertive societies, technology acceptance is higher because of low need of
face to face communication.
Future Orientation
Cultures typified by a long-term orientation are oriented towards future rewards, in particular
perseverance and thrift, while a short-term orientation is characterized by values relating to both
the past and present, in particular, the respect for tradition, preservation of ‘‘face’’ and the
fulfillment of social obligations(Al-Gahtani, Hubona, & Wang, 2007).
In one study Hofstede’s cultural dimensions were applied which showed that people in countries
with lower power distance, higher individualism, higher masculinity and low uncertainty
avoidance, intend to adopt a technology on basis of how useful that technology would be to them
in performing different tasks. They also argued that intention of people from countries that endorse
14
higher power distance, lower individualism, less masculinity and higher uncertainty avoidance, to
adopt technology is highly influenced by social norms (Syed & Malik, 2014).
2.6 Theory of planned behavior
For any technology to be effective, it is necessary that it should be used. It is not successful despite
its merits if it is not used. It is necessary to measure the important factors which can form the
behavior of users to use or not to use a technology. As discussed by Mathieson (1991), research in
social psychology shows that behavior is best predicted by an individual's attitude towards the
behavior (such as using an information system), rather than his or her attitude towards objects
involved in the behavior (such as the information system itself).
The theory of planned behavior is an extension of the theory of reasoned action made necessary
by the original model’s limitations in dealing with behaviors over which people have incomplete
volitional control (Ajzen, 1991). According to George (2004), for TPB, attitude toward the target
behavior and subjective norms about engaging in the behavior are thought to influence intention,
and TPB includes perceived behavioral control over engaging in the behavior as a factor
influencing intention.

Source: Ajzen (1991)
According to Ajzen (1991), the theory of planned behavior postulates three conceptually
independent determinants of intention. The first is the attitude toward the behavior and refers to
the degree to which a person has a favorable or unfavorable evaluation or appraisal of the behavior
in question. The second predictor is a social factor termed subjective norm; it refers to the
perceived social pressure to perform or not to perform the behavior. The third antecedent of
intention is the degree of perceived behavioral control whichrefers to the ease or difficulty of
performing the behavior and it is assumed to reflect past experience as well as anticipated
impediments and obstacles.
2.7 Empirical Evidence of Uber
Empirical evidence is the collection of information which is done by close observation to the
researches about a particular object. The observation comes up with questions and hypothesis
(Hulstijn & Laufer, 2001). The usage of Uber is different in different cities so, the 360-degree
16
effect of its usage can-not be identified very easily so, mostly, we needed to rely on the researches
which has already done by the other authors. We have focused on the Uber changing the usage of
taxi.
Uber Changes Taxi
By using the app in the smartphones, people can get comfortable rides in cheaper way. For the
sharing economy, taxis are facing new challenges. As the taxi prices are higher, people often feel
like riding in the cheaper and easier way. Uber uses the car which are rented by the owners in the
leisure time (Wallsten, 2015). There are some companies who provides ride to consumers but Uber
is the largest among those, it was launched in the year 2009 but by the mid of the year, it got eight
million users (Wallsten, 2015). Due to this increasing demand of Uber rides, the taxi drivers got
threatened and appealed to the politicians to ban the Uber service. In some cities, this appeal
worked as well.
Taxis always have been in imperfect competition unlike buses and other public transportations on
the other hand, Uber competes more directly. It is more obvious if people get more flexible and
desired level of service, they will immediately accept it in the democratic society. Traditionally
the consumers had a lot of complains for the taxi service as they charged high and to avoid these
extra cost, people were bound to take buses or metros but now, in shared economy, they have a
good incumbent and competitor, Uber (Wallsten, 2015).
Wage Impacts of Uber
According to the empirical concern, unobserved Uber drivers are shifting the employment in the
cities among taxi drivers. People who want to earn just by driving are taking the opportunities of
becoming an Uber driver in their leisure time. Therefore, the wage has declined for the drivers
who used to earn via driving taxis. The number of self-employed drivers has increased but the
professionals have declined. Not only the ride is cheaper than the taxi but also the service quality
is a lot better as the Uber drivers has more improved “customer-driver” matching. So, for this
competition, the traditional taxi drivers are facing a downward shift in their hourly wage rate
(Berger, Chen, & Frey, 2018).
The above empirical evidence is not generalized for all the countries across the world who are
using Uber as we have previously mentioned that in many countries or cities, the usage of this
17
digital ride has been banned so, the impact on employment and wage has been adopted according
to the rules of the economy (Berger et al., 2018).
Ride-sharing is Risky or Safe
Trust issues are arising regarding Uber in many cities. Safety is mentioned continuously, and it
has been claimed that Uber is not safe to ride compared to the traditional taxi rides. The safety is
not properly delivered regarding the third-party, passenger or even with the driver but on the other
hand, there is no much evidence regarding this unsafe condition (Feeney & companies Uber,
2015). The model of the ride sharing talks about great advantage though. Cash free transactions
and self-identification of the customers make the risk less severe. If I go for the explanation, the
cash has never been transacted by hand and the face of the passengers are not anonymous. So, even
if the passenger wants to harm the driver, the face can be identified very easily. On the other hand,
the background investigation of the Uber drivers is clearly checked which is not possible for the
taxi drivers. The passenger’s location and some information are also collected by the Uber drivers
(Feeney, 2015). It is also a very good way to reduce the risk of ride sharing.
Uber Affect Traffic Congestion
Traffic congestion is a great social issue which has been examined before and after Uber entry in
the urban area. Surprisingly, Uber reduced the traffic congestion in the urban areas (Zhang et al.,
2016). It is due to some reasons. Firstly, Uber contains more than one person in the car which
reduces the aggregate number of cars in the urban areas. On the other hand, it also reduces the
number of consumers in the busy areas or in the built-up areas. It provides less crowd in the road.
Secondly, Uber has a price movement policy that means the price of the ride sharing is higher in
the peak time so, people can adjust the timing of travelling or can use alternatives so, it gives a
smoother way of traffic in the road which reduces the congestion. Thirdly, the advanced
technologies like GPS in Uber, helps the driver to reach to the exact destinations without roaming
around in the streets which saves time, fuel, cost and of course reduces the congestion (Zhang et
al., 2016).
Customer’s Acceptance
Uber and other competitors are focusing on the mass service in the future by utilizing its advanced
technology but it is not sure or certain that the customers will also response positive towards it or
whether they will be accepting this service (Zhang et al., 2016). Certainly, the customer’s
18
perception of acceptation scenarios is different in the built-up and rural areas on the other hand,
political pressure is other factor which may put some restrictions in the Uber business in the long
term if it starts capturing the transport market fully. To capture, customer’s acceptances, the policy
makers of Uber has to highlight the positive consequences far more than the unintentional negative
outcomes of ride sharing (Zhang et al., 2016).
Overall, Uber has to adapt the new strategies and with passage of time, should concentrate on
tailoring the business model as there are threats which can affect the service and its adoption if
Uber does not build a strong barrier i.e. no chance for alternatives, strong advertisement campaign,
fulfilling dynamic changes of customer’s demand etc. to last long in the market.

CHAPTER 3: RESEARCH MODELS AND HYPOTHESES
3.1 Introduction
In the previous chapter, we have focused on the literature reviews along with many empirical
evidences on the usage of Uber. Based on those and also based on the purpose of our study, we
have come up with the models. In the previous chapter, we have also discussed few models and
finally we have decided to integrate two models, Theory of Planned Behavior and Technology
Acceptance Model. We have also put the Hofstede factors as mediator variables. After this fine
integration, we have come with many hypotheses which discusses the entire integration of the
models and give clear ideas what we actually wanted to focus. The whole re-developed model has
been subdivided and hypothesis are explained individually. The overall model has been inserted
below:
Figure 3. 1: Integration of TAM, TPB and Hofstede Cultural Dimensions
20
3.2 Development of Hypotheses
Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) describe that when a new technology is provided to the
consumers, there are factors which affects the usage and acceptance of the consumers. It explains
the perceived usefulness and the method of utilizing it in the daily lives (Venkatesh & Davis, 2000)
The model has been described by two wings, perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness. In
1985, Fred Davis has suggested this model examining the role of the mediating variables of
perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness (Davis, 1985). Researches have contributed
understandings of this model process outcomes. There are factors which are clustered which aids
the analysis to be happened (Legris, Ingham, & Collerette, 2003). In our study, we have shown the
perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use of sharing ride or shared economy with many
hypotheses and integration of models which carries many factors.
Perceived ease of use means the degree to which a particular system would be free from effort.
This means that if the system includes less efforts then it will be easily adaptable by the customers
and work performance goes up due to this, it will have a positive effect on the intention of the
behavior and vice versa. For example: If the Uber service turns out to be a very easy digital object
(app wise) then it decreases the effort of critical understandings to every type of end user. It brings
the technology and people closer which ultimately increasing the overall standard of living of a
nation. Adoption of any technological device or service has derived from the Technology
Acceptance Model (TAM). According to the previous studies, the relationship has remained
contradictory. If people feel like the usage of the technology has made the lives easier and better
then they will be willing to spend money on this and increase the value of their activities (Ramayah
& Ignatius, 2005). However, an internet purchaser has to develop the tendency of usefulness of
purchase. The purchaser will consider the perceived ease of use according to the benefits that he
or she is getting after purchasing online by using technology (Ramayah & Ignatius, 2005). On the
other hand, some people tend to stick to the traditional service or activities (Li et al., 2014) due to
lack of interest or may for due to some other reasons so, the perceived ease of use affects negatively
in this case (Wallsten, 2015). Overall, the experience describes the relation better whether it is
positive or negative towards the behavioral intentional.
Similarly, Perceived Usefulness means the degree to which a particular system enhances the
performance of a work (Davis, 1993). This means that if the quality of the performance increases
21
due to the use of a particular system, it will have a positive effect on the intention of the behavior.
For example: If the Uber service turns out to be a very efficient acceleration of time management,
cost management and healthy way of moving towards the destinations, people would love to accept
the ride sharing technology. Perceived usefulness actually gets affected by external variables also
(Satama, 2014). For example: Drunk people after the party are not allowed to drive so, in that case
they do need someone to drive home (someone who can be trusted and according to the consumer’s
choice). Even if they do not want to adapt the new technology but in this case, they are bound to
take help from ride sharing. In TAM model, perceived usefulness has a strong prediction of the
technology to be adapted by the end users (Satama, 2014). The usefulness of a new technology
prone to throw a very good vibe to the end users and it ultimately affects positively on the
behavioral intention (Amaro & Duarte, 2013).
Geert Hofstede has described the cross-cultural communication by theory of framework and Icek
Ajzen has fabricated the concept where the predictive power of the theory has been improved by
the actions of the perceived behavioral control. We have discussed about both of these concepts in
the previous chapter and now, we have integrated these two and developed our own model where
we have come up with some hypothesis and its branches.
Societies which have high power distance among each other are reluctant to adopt digitalization.
Low power distance societies are more independent and as the power is distributed more equally
(Yıldırım, Arslan, & Barutçu, 2016). According to (Straub et al., 1997), technology acceptance is
lower in high power distance culture compared to the low power distance society. In other words,
we can say that there is a negative correlation with the usage of internet and consumers where the
power distance is way too high (Gong, Li, & Stump, 2007). That means power distance is a very
powerful determinant for ride sharing attitudes. For example: Consumers, who are not independent
enough will not be sound towards using the technology and shared economy which ultimately
gives the adverse effect in the attitude towards the behavioral intention. May be the upper class
people have the access towards it but not below the standard class people so, the whole society
cannot be counted by the minor group of people.In fact, there are many people in the third world
country who even have never heard about the ride sharing even if they heard, they did not pay
attention to it or even if the paid attention, they are pretty much confused whether to grab this
22
facility or not as the reference from the peer group is not something positive or little positive. On
the basis of above discussion, following hypothesis has been derived:
Hypothesis 1a: Power distance moderates the relationship between attitude and behavioral
intention.
According to the previous discussion in the previous chapter, we have come to know that
uncertainty avoidance is the society’s tolerance for the ambiguity. Therefore, in high uncertainty
avoidance society, people are more prone to deal face to face and vice versa in low uncertainty
avoidance society (Ngai et al., 2007). As there is a trust issue and risk is included, people feel
reluctant to adapt the new technology (Choi & Geistfeld, 2004) and this has a negative effect on
the attitude towards the behavioral intention. People have a negative evaluation on the new
technology and ride sharing becomes a negative digital commodity for the consumers. People in
low uncertainty avoidance are more liable towards the app and it is vice versa in the high
uncertainty avoidance society so, here the consumers are more relaxed with the traditional taxi
services or to the public transportations. No matter the drivers of Uber has the information of the
consumers if they have been ordered online by using app, but the consumers are never sure about
the attitude or ethics or morality of the driver in ride sharing. So, it has a negative effect on the
attitude towards the behavioral intention of Uber (Yıldırım et al., 2016). So, based on above, we
hypothesize that:
Hypothesis 1b: Uncertainty avoidance affects the relationship between attitude and behavioral
intention.
Hofstede (2011) defines the individualist side of a cultures in which the ties between individuals
are loose: everyone is expected to look after him/herself and his/her immediate family (previously
explained). Uber is more popular in in the individualistic society rather in the collectivist society,
public transports are prioritized more as it thinks about the society a whole (Agyeman, McLaren,
& Schaefer-Borrego, 2013). Uber facilities are mostly consumed to increase owns performance,
owns mobility and owns comfort which truly goes with the “his- his – whose –whose”
characteristics. AirBnb or Uber are more popular in this kind of society as these people are more
likely in bartering, swapping and skill sharing (Agyeman et al., 2013). Therefore, it promotes
23
positive attitudes towards the behavioral intention of any new technology and adapts it more
quickly. According to the empirical evidence (Ardichvili et al., 2006), collectivist economies do
not welcome technology cordially or more often as they think it will disconnect people from having
“one to one” communication (Zakour, 2004). May be that is why it is very often to use Uber service
in mixed economies and market economies rather than the communist economies. The hypothesis
has been discussed so far in below:
Hypothesis 1c: Individualism moderates the relationship between attitude and behavioral
intention.
Masculinity society emphasizes on the accomplishment of the work rather feminist society focuses
more on the human relationship (Pavlou & Chai, 2002). For the accomplishment of any work done,
people can go beyond the face to face communication and masculine society is also considered as
assertive society too. Technology adaption is higher in this kind of society where the forceful
personality exists. They tend to be more technological as they do not care for human interaction
much. Uber usage and adaption are higher in assertive society. Due to work accomplishment,
people tend to be on time and reduce the hassle of the transportation problem (Manjoo, 2014). It
is far easy to use the app in the phone and share the ride rather than going for the traditional taxi
service or maintaining long queue in the public transportation. People in this society are more
willing to match their own needs so, in Uber or in any other online shopping, providing basic
information is accepted. Uber driver are tailored according to the needs of the customers and all
these are done by using the app in the phone (Zhang et al., 2016).We posit that:
Hypothesis 1d: Masculine or assertive society moderates the relationship between attitude
towards behavior and behavioral intention
Future orientation focuses more on the future planning in the society. The success of new
information system gets disturbed if there is too much lack of user acceptance (Davis, 1993)
Societies which are not organized properly for the future and more towards the success in the short
term, they will tend to use the technology and adapt those cordially because they want success in
anyhow and to be successful in the short period of time. Success cannot come quickly without the
24
technology adoption so, the societies have positive attitudes towards the behavioral intention
(Anbari et al., 2003). Long term oriented societies do have positive influence on the attitude
towards the behavioral intention but not as vigorous as the short term oriented as they have time
to allocate resources and utilize those efficiently (Anbari et al., 2003). Therefore, the society is
much more organized and efficient rather than non-future oriented society. There are more chances
of lacking in the productivity. So, Uber acceptance is more in non-future oriented society and
include much risk than the other. We suggest that:
Hypothesis 1e: Long term orientation moderates the relationship between attitude and
behavioral intention.
Subjective norm is defined as the pressure of the society to perform or not performing the behavior.
The technology has been adapted by the people differently which varied from culture to culture
(Zakour, 2004) In low power distance, technology adaption is more as people do not need to rely
on others pressure whether to accept the technology or not. So, social norms are less powerful in
low power distance society. Behavioral intention is positive in this society. Due to this positivity,
we cannot directly say that low power distance society does not support the behavioral intention
of technology due to social norms rather it moderates (Zakour, 2004). For example: People cannot
deny the order for the superior in the high-power distance society so, here the adaptation of the
technology by superior people also make the inferior people use it. Whether they like it or not,
they need to follow the instructions of the upper-class people. Therefore, the power distance
moderates the relation between the behavioral intention and social norms. It acts as the moderating
variable. We hypothesize:
Hypothesis 2a: Power distance moderates the relationship between the social norms and
behavioral intention.
In the internet era, people communicate with each other via online and it is certainly an innovative
way of communication. For online communication, people use some of their personal information
which is mandatory (Pookulangara & Koesler, 2011). Although there are cultural differences but
at the end of the day, it is all about getting connected online and it forms sharing information.
Countries where the uncertainty avoidance is higher, they are always too much flexible in their
word of mouth (Liu, Furrer, & Sudharshan, 2001). For example: if they get superior service via
25
online purchasing, they enthusiastically spread recommendations to other people or in peer group
and it happens totally opposite if by chance they do not receive the service as they expected. Same
goes with the Uber service, group of people who found it useful have recommended highly for ride
sharing and unfortunately who have suffered any loss both major and minor have exaggerated the
evaluation negatively. It is true that Uber do have some bad events in its career life, but high
uncertainty avoidance group has made it a lot bigger than the actual. So, social norms are very
tentative towards the behavioral intention in this case. Therefore, a possible hypothesis can be as
follow:
Hypothesis 2b: Relationship between social norms and behavioral intention is affected by
uncertainty avoidance.
Subjective norm is defined as the societal norm and social influence (Anbari et al., 2003; Pavlou
& Chai, 2002). Individuals are formed into clusters or groups and create social norms regarding
the technology. For example: Uber adoption or any kind of ride sharing becomes negatively
criticized in the society because of the exaggeration if it cannot fulfill the desired need of any
particular customer. The remarks spread very fast due to the “negative word of mouth”. They tend
to make their judgment and which depends on the norms of the groups (Hofstede & Bond, 1988).
In collectivist society, there are obligations to the group but in the individualistic society, people
are self-sufficient (Hofstede, 1980). Therefore, when a group of people fabricate or exaggerate the
service regarding the technology adaption, it definitely does not provide the strong positive relation
between the subjective norm and the intention of the behavior. Subjective norms have the greater
or bigger importance in the collectivist societies rather than the individualistic society in the need
of the group (Triandis, McCusker, & Hui, 1990). So, the following hypothesis can be postulated:
Hypothesis 2c: The relationship between societal norms and behavioral intention is moderated
by individualistic or collectivist factors.
Men are more strong towards the attitude of the technology but in the other hand, women are more
strong towards the subjective norm and it affects the behavioral intention (Venkatesh, Morris, &
Ackerman, 2000). For example: Uber or ride sharing can be easily used by men and there is less
tension about being harassed and even if there is harassment, it will affect women much more
compared to men. Women are more oppressed by the subjective norms or social norms in the
26
society while adapting any technology usage especially ride sharing service. This kind of pressure
is called “felt pressure from others” (Bandyopadhyay & Fraccastoro, 2007). This pressure is
general, and it influences the net use. It has a high predictive power but has a weak correlation
with the predictors. So, the behavioral intention is more influenced by the societal norms. General
social pressure on the individual is influenced by the differences of culture that means it varies
from culture to culture (Bandyopadhyay & Fraccastoro, 2007).
Perceived behavioral control refers to the perceived ease or difficulty of performing the behavior
and it is assumed to reflect past experience as well as anticipated impediments and obstacles. As a
general rule, the greater the perceived behavioral control, the stronger should be an individual’s
intention to perform the behavior under consideration (Ajzen, 1991). Two components of
perceived behavioral control, self-efficacy (individual judgments of a person's capabilities to
perform a behavior and controllability (individual judgments about the availability of resources
and opportunities to perform the behavior) have been discussed by Pavlou and Fygenson (2006).
Perceptions of an individual regarding his control on the action can lead to possible occurrence of
the outcome. A person who has a pessimistic view of his control over the behavior may never try
and may thus fail to find out that he was wrong. As a result, perceived control will usually correlate
with behavioral performance. Again, however, this correlation will tend to be strong only when
perceived control corresponds reasonably well to actual control (Ajzen, 1985). Therefore,
following hypothesis is posit:
Hypothesis 2d: Relationship between subjective norms and behavioral intention is influenced by
masculinity.
Subjective norm will not affect the user’s intention as the future orientation focuses on the longterm planning is a powerful determinant of the user acceptance in the society which plans for the
long-term benefits. The technology adaption is commonly seen in this society and it is free from
the typical norm of the society. It instructs or guides the managers of a society to reduce the underutilization of the computer technology (Bandyopadhyay & Fraccastoro, 2007). From the previous
studies, it has been examined that the future oriented societies or cultures motivates the use of
web based information system as the information are more flawless and provides a better outcome
(Mun & Hwang, 2003). The societal pressure which is also called to be subjective norm, does
27
spread good vibes to the behavioral intention of the sharing economy and technology acceptance.
So, we present the following hypothesis:
Hypothesis 2e: Future orientation influences the relationship between subjective norms and
behavioral intention.
Power Distance has been defined as the extent to which the less powerful members of
organizations and institutions (like the family) accept and expect that power is distributed
unequally (Hofstede, 2011). Power distance is important factors towards adoption of a technology.
People tend to make opinions based on attitude of their leaders who are supposed to have greater
power. According to Moon, Chadee, and Tikoo (2008), in high power distance societies, status
que and age are very important and people tend to be less innovative. In the light of above
discussed literature, we can see that in high power distance societies people tend to be affected by
elders or seniors and therefore would be unable to show full control of behavior on any decision.
Therefore, we can posit the following hypothesis:
Hypothesis 3a: Perceived behavioral control towards buying behavior is moderated by high
power distance societies.
In high uncertainty avoidance culture, consumers are resistant to change from established patterns
and will be focused on risk avoidance and reduction and according to Hofstede, in countries where
uncertainty avoidance is high, a feeling of "what is different is dangerous" prevail (Steenkamp,
Hofstede, & Wedel, 1999). Uncertainty avoidance is “related to anxiety, need for security and
dependence upon experts” (Ford, Connelly, & Meister, 2003). We can say that self-efficacy in
perceived behavioral control is less in high uncertain avoidance societies because people avoid
taking risks and are dependent upon others for security. So, the following hypothesis has been
derived:
Hypothesis 3b: Perceived behavioral control towards buying intention is affected in high
uncertain avoidance societies.
28
The third cultural dimension is individualism vs collectivism. In individualistic societies people
are focused on personal needs while collectivist societies are more networked and combined
through group needs. As discussed by Steenkamp et al. (1999), Collectivistic cultures are
conformity oriented and show a higher degree of group behavior and concern to promote their
continued existence, whereas people in individualistic societies are emotionally more detached
from in-groups and place their personal goals, motivations, and desires ahead of those of the ingroup (Kagitcibasi 1997). For this we can come up with a notion that personal controlling
behavioral is affected by groups in collectivist societies, therefore following hypothesis can be
deducted:
Hypothesis 3c: Collectivist societies affect the relationship between perceived behavioral control
and buying intention.
Fourth dimension of culture is masculinity. As the literature studies earlier, we can see that
masculinity shows the assertiveness and achievement. Popular view of this dimension is to view
the masculine and feminine culture in terms of emphasis of competitiveness and material success
versus nurturance and quality of life, rather than in terms of gender roles for the sexes (Ford et al.,
2003). Achievement can be related to gaining access to latest discovery or invention as indicated.
High masculinity reinforces the effect of high resultant self-enhancement. The converse is true for
societies low in masculinity (high in femininity (Steenkamp et al., 1999). From the above
argument, it is assumed that in masculine societies, perceived behavioral control tends to be higher
in order to show assertiveness and achievement. Therefore, we hypothesize:
Hypothesis 3d: Masculinity affects the relation between behavioral intentions towards purchase
behavioral control
Future orientation is another cultural dimension suggested by Hofstede. Long-term orientation
cultures value virtues oriented toward future rewards, in particular perseverance and thrift. Shortterm orientation stands for the fostering of virtues related to the past and present, in particular,
respect for tradition, preservation of “face” and fulfilling social obligations (Ford et al., 2003). A
long-term orientation means that people feel free to put off making a decision until they are
29
comfortable with its ramifications. In essence, this gives such people more control over their
actions (Pavlou & Chai, 2002). So, we can make following hypothesis:
Hypothesis 3e: Relation between perceived behavioral control and buying intention in long-term
orientation societies.
Trust is the most important factor involved in any kind of relationship. The development of trust
relies on the formation of a trustee’s expectations about the motives and behaviors of a trustee
(Doney & Cannon, 1997). According to a survey conducted by First Advantage (2015),
participation in sharing economy is bolstered when the trust is ensured (Kamal & Chen, 2016).
Shared economy revolves around trust factor and lack of this factor can also cause failure of
businesses. According to Dheepan, the sharing economy is here to stay but the wide participation
in this service and its reach will solely be dictated by the trustworthiness of a stranger (Kamal &
Chen, 2016). Mayer et al. defined trust as a behavioral one person based on his/her beliefs about
the characteristics of another person. Based on this definition, they proposed a model of dyadic
trust in organizational relationships that includes characteristics of both the trustor and trustee that
influence the formation of trust (Kim, Ferrin, & Rao, 2008). Although the transactions through
shared economy are conducted online, they are involved face to face interaction upon arrival (Ert,
Fleischer, & Magen, 2016). Therefore, attributes of a seller or service provider are vital in shared
economy. If a consumer finds that a supplier of a service possesses sufficient trust, he will be
inclined towards buying the service. We suggest:
Hypothesis 4: A consumer’s trust positively affects the behavioral intention towards purchase.
Bauer (1960) introduced the concepts of risk and uncertainty in marketing when he observed
“consumer behavior involves risk in the sense that any action of a consumer will produce
consequences which he cannot anticipate with anything anticipating certainty, and some of which
are likely to be unpleasant” (Quintal, Lee, & Soutar, 2010). Lee (2009) has discussed six risks
which are performance risk, social risk, financial risk, privacy risk, time risk and physical risk.
Traditional P2P marketplace involves only monetary risk whereas shared economy transactions
involve other risks as well even when there are no monetary risks involved (Ert et al., 2016). In
30
case of Airbnb, there is risk involved of staying with a stranger which can be harmful at times. For
example, an American was attacked by a dog of his host where he was living in a room got by
Airbnb (Lieber, 2015). Drivers of Uber taxi can also pose threats to the riders. Such as privacy risk
is very much talked in shared economy, either its Uber or Airbnb. As studied by Feeney and
companies Uber (2015), drivers of Uber get access of some of personal information of riders and
then they can contact them through social media which travelers consider an unethical behavior.
So, these examples portray that riders are vulnerable to service providers and that any risk
associated with these services can affect the buying intention of a consumer. We post that:
Hypothesis 5: Higher the risk associated with the service, lower will be the consumer’s intention
to purchase.

CHAPTER 4: RESEARCH METHODOLOGY
4.1 Introduction
The overall research model presented by us has 17 hypotheses in total and all of hose have been
well described in previous chapters. This chapter will talk about the empirical settings, data
collections, philosophical positions, geographical positions and finally the measurement of the
variables. In this chapter, procedures of the sample measurement and collection of data are
discussed by the authors.
4.2 Philosophical Position
All research is conducted on the basis of some assumptions or hypotheses. To conduct a qualitative
research, it is necessary to know the hidden the assumptions (Myers, 1997). Qualitative is not like
interpretive, though these have various common elements. Interpretative research is the
understanding of social reality and on the other hand, qualitative research is gathering nonnumerical data. The research rather depends on the philosophical assumptions of the researchers.
It is shown in the graph below:
Figure 4. 1: Underlying Philosophical Assumptions
Positivists claim that reality can be described by measurable properties which are not dependent
on researcher. Interpretive researchers claim that reality can be accessed through social
32
constructions i.e. language and critical researchers claim reality is historically constituted and it is
reproduced by people over time (Myers, 1997).
The collections of survey questionnaire are quantitative which aids to predict the behavior of the
consumers about the ride sharing. Quantitative observations provide the results of counts,
frequencies or percentages. This observation also includes time-interval sampling (Johnson &
Christensen, 2008). Our study has been established on the basis of Theory of Planned Behavior
and we have used both the qualitative and quantitative methods. Our research is both qualitative
and quantitative.
4.3 Research Design
Quantitative research includes observation, experiment and survey. The survey is done by the
researchers to know about the experience of the consumer’s regarding the usage of product or
service. Customers have been asked simple questions in the survey to get a clear and very specific
views about the product or service. Quantitative methods are built up or from the evaluation or
results of the statistically proven data. The research design of this study includes questions to the
general customers of Uber in Bangladesh and in Pakistan.
4.4 Questionnaire Design
The aim or purpose of the study is to understand or measure the factors which influence the
adoption of non-traditional mode of transport in a developing country. So, for this measurement,
we had to prepare questions that directly asks about the factors of our research model explained in
chapter 3. To prepare the questions, we had to go through many articles and followed the patterns
of items to measure the scales. Each of the question is measured on a Likert scale from 1 to 7. In
the research, we had simple questions which were easy to answer, and we also have used both
open and close ended questions. In the appendix, we have disclosed the questions chosen for this
master’s study.

4.5 Data Collection
Primary and secondary methods are used to collect the data for a particular project. Primary data
is basically the first-hand data and this data is collected for the basic research problem. Whenever
any new primary data is collected, existing store of social knowledge is being updated (Hox &
Boeije, 2005). On the other hand, when we collect the materials used by the other researchers is
known as secondary data (Hox & Boeije, 2005). The more authenticated data is primary more than
secondary and it is less time consuming too. In this study, we have used both the primary and
secondary data. For primary data, we have collected the survey from every class of Uber customer
and for secondary data, we have searched for most recent and valid articles regarding ride sharing,
shared economy and digitalization.
4.6 Survey and Procedure
As per the topic and geographical location, the survey was conducted in Bangladesh and Pakistan.
The two authors of this study come from these two South Asian Countries so, it was easier to
communicate in local language with the general people or customer though the questionnaire was
in English language. So, while knowing about the satisfaction of ride sharing in Uber was easy to
access and questions were based on these countries’ cultures. The respondents were only citizen
of either Bangladesh or Pakistan, but the residence was free of choice and not a mandatory option.
As we have posted the questionnaire online and shared via social media, it was quite easy to access
the answers or collect the respondents. They have dedicated their personal time and answered the
survey. Few of them had “one-to-one” conversation with the author of this study after finishing
the survey to make it more clearly about the satisfaction of Uber ride. The questionnaire contained
many questions and it was long to finish but was very easy to understand. In total, we have
collected 145 respondents as there was a day limit to collect the surveys. The authors of this survey
had direct communication and knocked all the respondents directly via e-mails and social medias
to finish up the survey. Near about 55 people did simply ignore the survey and did not cooperate
so, the survey could not fulfill its targeted number of respondents.

4.7 Measurements of the Constructs
In this chapter, the questions have been presented or shown on which constructs have been
prepared. After studying, we got to know that Likert-type scale can also refer to summated scales
as specific items assess between the total high and low scores (Jain & Kothari, 2004). Summated
scales actually communicate between the favorability and un-favorability of attitudes which have
been requested to the participants to respond in the questionnaire. A number of numeric scores are
given to the respondents which denote the favorability or un-favorability of the attitudes. The
summation is then required for the overall explanation of the behavioral intention by the
customers(Jain & Kothari, 2004).
Our overall model is the integration of three different research models as discussed in chapter 3.
From our integrated model, based on the concept, we have chosen 7 independent variables,
dependent variables which are opposite of the independent variable and control variables which
are the experimental elements and are constant. Each of the variables are clearly discussed below
in the sub points.
4.7.1 Dependent Variable
Behavioral Intention: According to Ajzen (1991), behavioral intention is being driven by other
variables (independent). As discussed earlier, we have used the factors of Hofstede as the
moderating variables. Therefore, we can see that the behavioral intention is evaluated by the
customers whether they are in favour or not in favvour of using a particular product or service.
The construction, source, original items and the adapted questions of behavioral intention from
(AGU, Enugu, & Onuka, 2016) and (Yu, 2012) shown below in Table 4.1:

4.7.2 Independent Variables
• Attitude Towards Behavior (ATB): According to Mathieson (1991), the intention of the
behavior is dependent on the attitude of the people towards a particular product or service.
According to George (2004), any attitude towards the specific or targeted behavior drives
the intention of that particular product or service. The construction, source, original items
and the adapted questions of attitude towards behavior from (Puriwat & Tripopsakul, 2017)
shown below in Table 4.2:

• Perceived Usefulness (PU): (Davis, 1993), explained that perceived usefulness enhances
the performance of the work. It motivates the behavioral intention of the customers either
positive or negative. We adopted question items for perceived usefulness from (GlaveeGeo et al., 2017) as shown below in Table 4.3:
• Perceived Ease of Use (PEU): means the degree to which a particular system would be
free from effort. If customers are happy enough or satisfied regarding a usage of any
product or service so, it affects the behavioral intention. We measured perceived ease of
use by adapting items from Glavee-Geo et al (2017) as shown below Table 4.4:

• Subjective Norm (SN): The usage intention is driven by the societal culture or norms and
it varies from culture to culture (Bandyopadhyay & Fraccastoro, 2007). Subjective norm is
powerful to maintain the behavioral intention as the acceptance or the rejection first comes
from the society especially in South East Asia. We measured subjective norm by adapting
item from (Puriwat & Tripopsakul, 2017) and (Glavee-Geo et al. 2017) as shown below

• Perceived Behavioral Control (PBC): This variable has the positive or negative effect on
the dependent variable, behavioral intention (Ajzen, 1991). Pavlou and Fygenson (2006)
discussed that individual’s capabilities are truly important in behavioral control for
affecting the behavioral intention. We measured perceived behavioral control by adapting
items from (Makongoro, 2014) as shown below Table 4.6:

• Trust (T): People need to have trust to purchase any product or service so, it is dictated by
the variable, trust (Kamal & Chen, 2016). The development of the trust makes the
behavioral intention work (Doney & Cannon, 1997). The construction, source, original
items and the adapted questions from Glavee-Geo et al. (2017) shown below in Table 4.7:

• Risk (R): People think that something unpleasant may happen while using the product or
service (Quintal et al., 2010). That is why, we have considered risk as an independent
variable. Therefore, these all do affect the intention of customers towards usage the product
or service. The construction, source, original items and the adapted questions for risk from
Glavee-Geo et al. (2017) and (Shaikh, Glavee-Geo, & Karjaluoto, 2018) shown below in

4.7.3 Moderating Variables
According to Lazarsfeld and Rosenberg, moderator variables can be considered a subset of a class
of variables termed, in the social sciences, "test" or specification variables. A specification variable
is one which specifies the form and/or magnitude of the relationship between a predictor and a
criterion variable (Sharma, Durand, & Gur-Arie, 1981).
• Power Distance (PD): Power distance shows the degree of inequality among people which
the people of a population considers normal (Straub et al., 1997). Power distance,
measured by adapting questions from (Dash & Guin) shown below on Table 4.9:

CHAPTER 5: MEASUREMENT ASSESSMENT AND DATA
VALIDATION
5.1 Introduction
Previous chapter, we have discussed about the research methodology. In this chapter,
measurements of the variables are discussed and analyzed. Various issues have been focused such
as we have discussed the descriptive analysis, factor analysis and reliability analysis. The data
assessment and data inspection have been also done in this chapter and after focusing on the
discussion of the constriction of the data, conclusion is being written.
5.2 Descriptive Statistics Analysis and Data Examination
5.2.1 Data Screening and Cleaning
Before we start analyzing the data, it is too much essential to look or check for the errors so that
we get near about perfect result after the analysis (Pallant, 2013). Mistakes are done while
collecting single entries i.e. misspelling of any names or data (Rahm and Do 2000). Data screening
and cleaning includes detecting the data and removing errors in the inconsistencies. This cleaning
method is important or needed while integrating the heterogeneous data sources. The need for data
cleansing increases when the multiple data sources are collected i.e. data warehousing (Rahm &
Do, 2000). The major data problems can be solved by data cleansing. For screening of data, there
are steps 1. Checking for errors, scores that are out of range, 2. Finding and correcting the error in
data file, correcting or deleting the wrong figure from the file (Pallant, 2013).
5.2.2 Descriptive Analysis of the Data
When the cleaning and scrutinizing of the data has been done then comes the descriptive analysis.
According to (Pallant, 2013), descriptive analysis describes characteristics of sample, check
violation of the assumptions underlying the statistical questions and address specific research
48
quest5ions. The descriptive statistics include the mean, standard deviation, range of scores,
skewness and kurtosis (Pallant, 2013).
The statistics obtained by this analysis is utilized as the illustration of the sample too. The result
of descriptive statistics of our research is shown below on the Table-5.1 and Appendix-1.

In the above table, minimum value is 1 and maximum value is 7 except for two questions regarding
‘Behavioral Intention’ and one question regarding ‘Perceived Usefulness’ where minimum value
is 2. It shows the range and variety of answers of respondents. For all the items on Likert scale
from 1-7, mean value ranges from 2.03 to 5.75 and standard deviation ranges from 1.281 to 1.83.
According to (Pallant, 2013), skewness values provide indication of the symmetry of the
distribution and kurtosis provides peakedness of the distribution. According to the rule, values of
kurtosis is not more than 10 so it shows that there is no problem with data.
Socio-demographic Information:
The sample consists of 145 respondents from Bangladesh and Pakistan (Appendix-2). More than
half of the respondents fall in the age group from 25 to 30 years. Almost 99% are below 45 years
which show that relativity of data as Uber service is mostly used by students or people who are at
their early stage of career. Male respondents are slightly more than the female respondents that is
merely due to the Asian culture. Among the respondents, almost 50% are single and 47% are
married. Education level of the respondents is quite high showing more than 98% of the sample is
undergraduate. In terms occupation, there is a bit variation. 35% of the sample is students and same
percentage is for private employees while 11% are public employees. 9% are entrepreneur and
same number is of unemployed. This variation is good for the study as students mostly travel in
form of groups to save some money and private employees are not getting paid much so either
they share the ride or travel through public transport.

5.2.3 Factor Analysis of the Data
To condense a large set of data into small, we use factor analysis. It is done by summarizing the
underlying pattern of correlation i.e. grouping the closely related items (Pallant, 2013). This
method allows the researchers to assemble the variables into factors (but it depends on the
relationship among the variables we have). There are two types of factor analysis Exploratory
Factor Analysis (EFA) and Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA). EFA is used in the early stage
of research often. On the other hand, VFA is a more sophisticated set of techniques to confirm
specific hypothesis or theory (Costello & Osborne, 2005). Often, these two produce similar results
but the approaches of the recommendation are different (Pallant, 2013). According to (Pallant,
2013), to check the suitability of data, sample size has to be not less than 150 (our study contains
160 samples) and the strength of the relation between variables. Table-5.2 and Appendix-3 shows
the factor analysis (Rotated Component Matrix, KMO and Bartlett’s Test and Total Variance
Explained) of the variables included in our research model:

Extraction method: Principal Component Analysis.
Rotation Method: Varimax with Kaiser Normalization
a. Rotation converged in 16...
The factor analysis given in Table-5.2 is based on rotated component which is obtained through
Varimax with Kaiser Normalization method. SPSS was run with 14 factors and it was converged
with 16 iterations. There were some components which had loading less than 0.5 and were
removed, therefore. After that 12 factors were included in the study.
To verify the suitability of data set for factor analysis, two values were considered. First is the
KMO value which is 0.895 in the study which is above the minimum threshold value of KMO that
is 0.6. The other test to check the suitability of data is Barlett’s Test of Sphericity. Significant value
should be 0.05 or less and, in this study the Barlett’s test is significant (p=.000). (Appendix-3.1).
5.3 Reliability of Measurements
Reliability is assessed by the scale’s stability on repeated measures. A scale is invalid if reliability
demonstrates higher assurance of the validity (Smith & Albaum, 2012). According to (Smith &
Albaum, 2012), an irregular scale can be an authentic scale. To represent the concept of interest,
measurement is important. The reliability of scale indicates that how the data set is free from
random errors. Test-retest reliability and internal consistency are two frequent indicators for the
reliability of measurements.
Test-retest is assessed to the same people in two different occasions and afterwards calculating the
correlation of two scores found out. Reliability can be assessed as internal consistency. Internal
consistency is the degree where items which make up scale are underlying in the same attribute
i.e. extent to which items are hang together (Pallant, 2013). There are four types of measurement
scale: ordinal, nominal, ratio and interval.
According to (Nunnally, 1978), a minimum level of 0.7 while different levels of reliability are
needed. Cronbach alpha is dependent on the number of items i.e. if items are less than 10 then the
56
alpha value can be very small so, it is then better to calculate the mean inter-item correlation and
it ranges from 0.2 to 0.4 (Briggs & Cheek, 1986).
Table-5.3 below and Appendix-4 show the reliabilities if the variables included in our research
model.
Table 5. 3: Reliability Analysis

Perceived Behavioral Control PBC 1,2 2 .863
Trust T 1,2,3,4 4 .871
Behavioral Intention BI 1,2,3,4 4 .916
According to the studies, values of Cronbach’s alpha above 0.7 are acceptable and above 0.8 are
preferable. In this table two factors have value slightly less than 0.8 but greater than 0.7 and rest
all are higher than 0.8 which show a good internal consistency in the data.
57
5.4 Validity
Validity is one of the important scales of the measures. Only reliability is not enough, validity is
also needed in order to reduce the measurement errors. Validity is the scale which actually
measures what it is supposed to (Pallant, 2013).
Our willingness to make the research more accurate and correct, validity is very much important
which reliability alone cannot do (Streiner, Norman, & Cairney, 2015).
Therefore, the measurement becomes valid and to do so, validity collects the empirical evidence.
Validity makes the data near about perfect and correct according to the models used in the research
(Hooper, Coughlan, & Mullen, 2008).
(Pallant, 2013), discuss about Content validity which measures from the domain of content,
criterion validity relates the scores and measurable criteria and construct validity tests the scale
derived theoretically from hypothesis. We will talk about two measures of construct validity
below, convergent validity and discriminant validity.
5.4.1 Convergent Validity
Convergent validity in this model is measured from the correlation matrix in the Factor Analysis
by observing the smallest correlation within the factor and then checking its value and level of
significance. The smallest value of correlation should be greater than 0.5 and it should be
significant at .000. In the correlation matrix, all the smallest values of correlation within the same
factors are significant.
The other way of estimating convergent validity is through average loading factor. By looking at
the rotated component matrix in the factor analysis we find that average loading factor is greater
than 0.7 and all the loads of factors in a construct are distinctively on one component.
Another way to estimate convergent validity is through Average Variance Extracted (AVE). AVE
is calculated by summating the squared loadings of all items in one component and then diving the
sum by the number of items. In this study factors are sharing higher common variance, proving
convergent validity.
58
5.4.2 Discriminant Validity
First basic way to measure discriminant validity is through correlation matrix approach. In this
method we observe the minimum correlation value of a construct and then measure it against
correlation of all items of another construct. If the correlation of the first construct is greater than
all other correlation, then there is no violation and it proves that there is discriminant validity
among all the constructs.
Another good approach is to use Average Variance Extracted and Shared Variance test. AVE
should be higher that the squared correlation between constructs. In the following table it is shown
that AVE for a construct is greater than the squared correlation of those constructs. In the following
Table-5.4 squared correlation has been calculated on the basis of correlation matrix of all factors.

For example, squared correlation between Behavioral Intention and Uncertainty Avoidance is
0.189 and AVE for BI is 0.678 while for UA is 0.405 and both are greater than 0.189. Similarly,
59
after checking AVE for all constructs, it is proved that it is greater than square correlation among
them and hence indicates discriminant validity.
Summary
In this chapter, data were assessed. The authors made descriptive statistics analysis and data
inspection. In this chapter, the reliability and validity of measurements were analyzed. The
reliability was assessed by author using the Cronbach’s alpha and validity was assessed by the
means of the several items factors loadings and the Average Variance Extracted (AVE). Coming
up on the following chapter, authors would like to show data analysis and the empirical findings
of this research.

CHAPTER 6: DATA ANALYSIS AND EMPIRICAL FINDINGS
6.1 Introduction
Multiple regression analysis has been presented in this chapter by the authors based on the data
analysis in the previous chapter. Exploration of the results of the importance of particular attributes
will be there in the chapter of Uber in Bangladesh and Pakistan.
6.2 The importance of Uber
We have gathered total 145 respondents via our survey and all of them have used Uber as their
shared transportation in both the countries Bangladesh and Pakistan. All the respondents were
asked to rank each measuring questions from 1 till 7. “1” stands for completely disagree and “7’
stands for completely agree in our survey questionnaire.
Certainly, there have been other ride sharing (local) which were also preferred by many of the
respondents so, Uber has earned both negative and positive feedbacks from general customers.
Compared to Pakistani customers, Bangladeshi customers have responded more and it simply
shows that Uber is more popular in Bangladesh than in Pakistan. The tables below will show the
breakdown of importance of Uber in respective countries and also the responses about the usage
of Uber.
6.3 Model Estimation
Ordinary Least Square (OLS) Regression Model has been followed for the estimation of the model.
Model is described in form of following equation:

6.4 Result’s Estimation
The regression model explains the relation between dependent variable and seven independent
variables. Three of the independent variables are moderated by five moderating variables and
hence these have been described as well. Except them, six control variables have been included
along with one constant (b0) and error term.
6.4.1 Correlation Matrix
Correlation matrix has been presented in below table 6-2 and appendix 5-2. The correlation matrix
consists of Behavioral Intention as dependent variable and others as independent variables
including control variables and interaction effects of other independent variables. Perceived
usefulness shows the maximum correlation with the dependent variable followed by attitude
towards behavior and perceived behavioral control. Minimum correlation is between BI and Age
log showing that age does not affect the dependent variable. Following tables show the correlation
matrix:

6.4.2 Regression Analysis
In multiple regression analysis, all the independent variables are entered and evaluated by its
predictive power. This is done over and above predictive power of all the other independent
variables (Pallant, 2013). All the independent variables are processed to have high forecast than
the others. It has also explained that in the total forecast’s contribution, the weights of independent
variables and the impacts of each variable’s prediction (Hair, Ringle, & Sarstedt, 2013). Below,
the tables and appendix-5 show the research’s multiple regression analysis:
Multi-collinearity was assessed by Collinearity Diagnostics. These are shown by two values i-e:
Tolerance and VIF (appendix 5-5). As explained by Pallant (2013), Tolerance is an indicator of
how much of the variability of the specified independent is not explained by the other independent
variable in the model and VIF (Variance Inflation Factor) which is just the inverse of the Tolerance
Value (1 divided by Tolerance). Value for tolerance below 0.10 and value for VIF above 10
indicate the multiple correlation with other variables and proving the possibility for multicollinearity. Variables having multi-collinearity have been removed and hence current values of
Tolerance and VIF in the table show the absence of multi-collinearity. Overall statistical
significance of the model is assessed by Model Summary (appendix 5-3) which shows sig. = .000
which mean p<.0005. R square 0.495 shows 49.5% variance in the dependent variable is explained
by the model. However, value of R square is optimistic estimation of the model and we need to
count Adjusted R square which is .345 which is corrected to give better picture of the results. Two
control variables Gender and Nationality having t values -2.53 and 2.354 respectively are
significant (p<.05 two-tailed). Independent variables which are significant are Attitude Towards
Behavior and Risk. There is one interaction effect which is combined with Attitude Towards
Behavior and Masculinity which is the highest in the model having t value of 3.577 and significant
at two-tailed (p<.01). Table 6-3 and appendix 5-5 shows the multiple regression below:

Hypothesis 1d: Masculine or assertive society moderates the relationship between attitude and
behavioral intention
Values of b4(ATB)(MAS)=.218, t=3.557 and p<.01 one-tailed. It shows a highly positive relation
between Attitude Towards Behavior and Behavioral Intention which is positively moderated by
Masculinity. It is supported by statistical regression.
Hypothesis 2a: Power distance moderates the relationship between the social norms and
behavioral intention
We see that b6(SN)(PD)=.061, t=.757 and p>.05 one-tailed and proves no relation through
statistical regression.
Hypothesis 2b: Uncertainty Avoidance moderates the relationship between the social norms and
behavioral intention
We can see that b7(SN)(UA)=0.211, t=1.87 and p<.01 two-tailed. This hypothesis is supported by
statistical regression showing a positive relation between social norms and behavioral intention in
uncertainty avoidance society.
Hypothesis 2c: The relationship between societal norms and behavioral intention is moderated by
individualistic or collectivist factor
From table, b8(SN)(IND)=-0.044, t=-.461 and p>.05 one-tailed show that there is negative
association and it is not supported by statistical regression.
Hypothesis 2d: Relationship between subjective norms and behavioral intention is influenced by
masculinity
69
We see that b9(SN)(MAS)=-.052, t=-702 and p>.05 one-tailed and the negative association is also
not supported by statistical regression.
Hypothesis 2e: Future orientation influences the relationship between subjective norms and
behavioral intention
We see that b10(SN)(LTO)=-.044, t=-.497 and p>.05 one-tailed and there is negative association,
hence it is not supported by statistical regression.
Hypothesis 3a: Perceived behavioral control towards buying behavior is moderated by high
power distance societies
b11(PBC)(PD)=.015, t=.189 and p>.05 one-tailed show that the association is not significant hence
hypothesis is not supported.
Hypothesis 3b: Perceived behavioral control towards buying intention is affected in high
uncertain avoidance societies
From regression findings, we see that b12(PBC)(UA)=-.198, t=-1.763 and p<.05 two-tailed.
Hypothesis is supported by the result showing that in conditions of uncertainty avoidance, PBC
has a negative relation towards Behavioral Intention.
Hypothesis d: Masculinity affects the relation between behavioral intentions towards purchase
behavioral control
We see that b14(PBC)(MAS)=-.022, t=-.259 and p>.05 one-tailed and it is showing a negative
association which is not supporting the hypothesis.
Hypothesis 6: A consumer’s trust positively affects the behavioral intention towards purchase
70
The values of b16T=.006 and t=.067 show that this association is not significant and p>.05 one
tailed which does not support the hypothesis.
Hypothesis 7: Higher the risk associated with the service, lower will be the consumer’s intention
to purchase
We see that b17R=-.159, t=-1.806 and p<.05 one-tailed which show that Behavioral Intention is
negatively affected by increase in risk. So, hypothesis is supported.
Normality, linearity, homoscedasticity and independence of residuals
When we look at the normal probability plot of the regression standardized residual (appendix:5-
6,5-7), we see that all the points lie in a straight diagonal line with slightly deviation. This is further
evident from the probability curve which is a bell-shaped and showing the centralization of the
data.
In the scatterplot of the standardized residuals (appendix 5-8), residuals seem to be distributed in
the rectangle. According to Tabachnick and Fidell, outliers are those cases which have
standardized residual of more than 3.3 or less than -3.3 (Pallant, 2013). By looking at the scatterplot
generated by SPSS, we see that all the residuals ae within the range suggested by Tabachnick and
Fidell. The presence of outliers can be detected by inspecting the scatterplots. If there are only a
few, as Pallant suggested, it is not necessary to take action, because it is not uncommon to find
residuals that are outliers when dealing with large samples (Pallant, 2013).
By taking all the assumptions into account, we can say that there is no violation of normality,
homoscedasticity and independence of residuals, hence further analysis can be done.
6.6 Summary
In the above chapter, by using the multiple regression analysis, the empirical data was thoroughly
discussed. By utilizing an estimation technique named, OLS which stands for Ordinary Least
Square, hypotheses were tested. Earlier, 19 hypotheses were presented, some of them showed the
direct relation and some were having moderation effect. After analyzing the results, some
hypotheses were removed which were having multi-collinearity. In the end, there is direct effect
by only one independent variable while one more independent variable Attitude Towards Behavior
71
which is affecting the BI when it is moderated by Masculinity. Except these, Gender and
Nationality being control variable are statistically significant. In the upcoming and last chapter,
we are going to discuss about the implication of our theory and statistical results. The discussion
will walk along with the limitations and recommendations as well.
72
CHAPTER 7: CONCLUSION
7.1 Introduction
In the previous chapters, authors have discussed the results which have been achieved via empirical
tests. All the hypothesis tests have been discussed along with the estimation of the research
business model. Lastly but not the least, the discussion and conclusion of this entire research will
be presented in this Chapter. The chapter begins with a summary of the findings of the research
following the discussion and then lastly the conclusions. Authors of the research came up with two
precious recommendations for Uber in Pakistan and Bangladesh which is the main attraction of
this chapter. Further this chapter will include theoretical and managerial implications and
limitations of the study. Then the chapter will end with the suggestions for future research.
7.2 Findings’ Summary
The main purpose of this master’s research is to explore the behavior patterns of consumers
towards adoption of Uber in Bangladesh and Pakistan. Overall, 145 respondents have answered
the survey questionnaire from both the countries. In this master’s research, we have mixed three
business models i.e. Theory of planned behavior, Technology Acceptance Model and Hofstede's
cultural dimensions theory and created our business model where we have 1 dependent variable,
7 independent variables, 5 moderating variables and 7 control variables. We have come up with
total 17 hypotheses clearly explained in chapter three of this study. Though, in the empirical study
of this research has shown that 4 hypotheses out of 17 have successfully supported this study.
From the descriptive analysis of data, we found out that the sample consists of 145 respondents
from Bangladesh and Pakistan. Maximum respondents are under the age of 45 years and male
respondents are slightly more than the female respondents that is merely due to the Asian culture.
Most respondents are single and undergraduate education level is much higher. In our respondents,
students are higher than any other occupation. The table 7-1 below shoes the relationship between
hypotheses and variables.

7.3 Discussion and Conclusion
The findings of the study have been discussed below to explore the purpose and aim of study.
After completion of the findings, many of the hypotheses were not supported. It shows that either
there was no relation at all among variables or it was too insignificant to support the hypothesis.
Only four hypotheses were supported from the finding. First supported hypothesis is a positive
moderating effect of masculine or assertiveness on relation between attitude towards behavior and
behavioral intention of purchasing the service. As discussed in literature that in masculine
societies, people tend to take risk and they are more open towards new technologies. Hence this
hypothesis is proved by the study that people in Bangladesh and Pakistan, which are masculine
societies, show positive attitude towards buying the service of Uber.
Second supported hypothesis is the positive impact of social norms on behavioral intention in the
uncertainty avoidance societies. According to (Ajzen, 1991), subjective norms refer to social
pressure in terms of performing or not performing some action. People try to spread word of mouth
to get favorable results in uncertain conditions. This is supported by study that social norms have
positive relation towards behavioral intention in uncertainty avoidance situation.
Third hypothesis which is supported by the study is negative moderation effect of uncertainty
avoidance on relation between perceived behavioral control and behavioral intention. Result shows
that people are not open towards buying a service when the situation is uncertain.
Last hypothesis supported by study is the negative relation between risk and behavioral intention.
This hypothesis is supported showing that if there is risk involved in a service, especially Uber,
tendency of people towards buying a service decreases. As discussed earlier, this risk involves
information risk, privacy risk and other uncertainties regarding usage of a service. When customers
confront any situation of uncertainty, it increases the risk associated to that service and hence
decreasing the probability of usage.
Moreover, study shows that the students of both Bangladesh and Pakistan have more urge to share
ride in Uber and authors have extracted this information from the survey questionnaire. In study
dummy variable for female is 0 while for male is 1. The result shows that female have more
intention to use the Uber service as compared to male. Even though the price of Uber service is a
bit high than other local ride sharing service, people do prefer Uber as this is global and more risk
75
free. On the other hand, people do have slight demand or requirements from Uber to be a bit
cheaper compete more locally. Uber brand is importantly playing a good role as this is the pioneer
ride sharing in both countries. Different customers’ expectations are different from Uber and it
varies from man to man. There are different factors which have been influencing the behavioral
intention of customers towards Uber. This ride sharing is more tailored and transparent to all.
Digitalization has affected the population of Bangladesh and Pakistan to get more synchronized
and customized transportation service. So, overall it is the rapid changing demand era where
people have been seeking more something which is beyond the traditional service of transports.
However, authors have created or designed a research model with many independent variables and
hypotheses, but all the hypotheses have not supported this research and neither all the independent
variables did support.
7.4 Implications of Study
7.4.1 Theoretical Implications
The theoretical implication of this study is that it explores which of the factors contribute towards
behavioral intention of consumers towards buying a service. This model integrates three models,
i-e; Theory of Planned Behavior, Technology Adoption Model and Hofstede Cultural Dimensions.
It further involves two extra independent variables Risk and Trust. The study shows that when
Hofstede dimensions interact with elements of Theory of Planned Behavior, only two cultural
dimensions affect the relationship between TPB and Behavioral Intention of using Uber.
Masculinity as a cultural dimension interacts with Attitude towards Behavior (ATB) while
Uncertainty Avoidance (UA) interacts with Social Norms (SN) and Perceived Behavioral Control
(PBC). It provides a scope to investigate moderating effects of Hofstede’s Cultural Dimensions on
TPB in different cultural settings. The study also shows how Technology Adoption Model interacts
with the dependent variable. Further, gender as a control variable shows that female are more
interested in using Uber service than male. Over all, attitude towards behavior positively affects
the behavioral intention in masculine societies; uncertainty avoidance moderates the relation
between social norms and behavioral intention and between perceived behavioral control and
behavioral control while risk is a main factor which hinders the behavioral intention of customers.
76
7.4.2 Managerial Implications
Study shows that female are more interested in using Uber service. Uber has an opportunity to
focus on male customers while retaining their female consumers which are more as compared to
male customers. Results also show that in uncertain situations people tend to rely on word of
mouth, so this technique should be adopted by Uber to spread awareness. Moreover, it shows how
risk decreases the tendencies towards intentions towards using the Uber service. As given in
literature how risk is affecting the perception of people towards shared services, this study provides
a specified phenomenon of risk associated with Uber. One more factor to work on is how people
are responding to the digitalization in these masculine societies.
After conducting the whole research of Uber customer satisfaction in Bangladesh and Pakistan,
following specific possible managerial implications have been suggested according to the given
norms and cultures of these countries.
Go “Glocal”
Undoubtedly, Uber is the pioneer of ride sharing in Bangladesh and Pakistan which has upgraded
the transport standard in these countries and won the heart of many ride users. Eventually, Uber
has become threats for public transportation as our research has discussed it in chapter 2 in
“Empirical Evidence of Uber”. Despite of being threat, most people love using Uber as this has
made their lives much flexible in busy traffics. There is a “But” in here, Uber is a global company
and it does follow globalization but to become the successful market leader in long term, Uber has
to adapt “localization” too. May be for time being or for short run, Uber is the leader in ride sharing
in Bangladesh and Pakistan but may be in the long run, the position can be hunt by any other local
ride sharing company as they are more customized according to the local choice. So, being global
and adapting localization or tailoring the current place’s taste makes the business stays longer and
rises the barriers of entry for new comers. Meaning of Glocal is explained as;
A good local company named, “Pathao” in Bangladesh and “Careem” in Pakistan do offer bike
service to customers which is faster than car in heavy traffics as both the countries are always
heavily congested in traffic. On the other hands, these services are cheaper compared to Uber.
Customers have been asking if Uber can introduce bike services at cheaper rate or not. So, Uber
must beat its small local competitors to be a long-time market leader.
77
Introduce Lady Driver
Certainly, Uber has been maintaining its safety in both the research countries, but some female
customers do have doubt or fear of being alone in the car late night. As Uber is a tailored ride
sharing so, it can introduce the lady or female drivers may be not as many in number according to
male drivers but few or may be 25% of the male driver quantity. They must only serve female
customers and if any male customer wants to travel in case of emergency then he must have a
woman with him in the car as ride sharer. The system can vigorously increase the usage of Uber
among customers which may make the demand for Uber near to perfectly inelastic in both the
countries. Then may be a bit high price of Uber will not make any big change in its demand because
people will ultimately look at the proper safety.
7.5 Limitation of the Study
First limitation with the study is collection of data on social media. Going to the countries of study
was not possible, hence limiting the direct interaction with the consumers. Another limitation is
using closed ended surveys/questionnaires only. This method alone cannot be sufficient as there
should be more methods of collecting data to get responses of people. This study involves different
theories and combines different countries, making it a complex model to study. To complete this
study in a limited time is also a limitation of this study. Data of two countries has been collected
and combined. On the basis of inductive reasoning, it is supposed that result would have similar
implication in both countries. Study would be more refined if the comparison of both countries
could have been done.
7.6 Future Research
This research has been conducted from the views of only two countries and both countries
(Bangladesh & Pakistan) share almost similar cultures so, in future it will be better if the research
will be conducted between more countries or at least countries which have different cultures so,
the usage’s effect will be more diversify. Also, as this research had a very limited time frame, we
recommend the future researchers to conduct any research on Uber’s customer satisfaction with a
vast or enough time period so that more primary respondents can be connected. The future research
in Uber should be in a country where there is Uber service available and not from long distance so
that the data can be collected through face-to-face and one-on-one interviews.
